# CCMgen and CCMpredPy

This repository provides a Python toolkit for learning second-order Markov Random Field (MRF) models from multiple sequence alignments of a protein families and using these models for generating realistic synthetic protein sequences. 

CCMpredPy is a fast implementation of an evolutionary coupling method for learning a Markov Randon Field (MRF) Model for a protein family. The parameters of the MRF can either be ingerred by pseudo-likelihood maximization or with persistent contrastive divergence.
While state-of-the-art pseudo-likelihood models have consistenly been found to work best for the purpose of predicting residue-residue contacts, models learned with persistent contrastive divergence are much more accurate in their fine statistics and are recommended for the use with CCMgen to generate realistic sequence samples.

CCMgen is a tool for sampling protein-like sequences from a second-order Markov Randon Field (MRF) model, such as it can be learned with CCMpredPy. The residues of generated sequences will obey the selection pressures described by the MRF with pairwise statistical couplings between residue positions. Furthermore, CCMgen provides full control over the generation of the synthetic alignment by allowing to specify the evolutionary times and phylogeny along which the sequences are sampled.
## This version is very different from the original version
## it allows regularization matrix settings

## Dependencies

- CCMgen/CCMpredPy was developed and tested with Python 3.6
- There are some C libraries to speed up crucial parts of the calculations that need to be compiled with a C compiler.
  Note: When installing on osx, make sure to use an appropriate gcc compiler and not clang, e.g. by setting `export CC=/usr/local/Cellar/gcc/X.X.X/bin/gcc-X` if gcc was installed via brew.

The following Python packages are required

  * NumPy 
  * SciPy
  * BioPython 
  * MsgPack 
  * six 
  * plotly 
  * colorlover
